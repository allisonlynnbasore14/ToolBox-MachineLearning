General trend in the curve?
1) As expected, it increases gradually as the percentage of data used for training increases. It only reaches 23% accuracy though. It reaches this max with 95 percent of stat used for training. 


Are there parts of the curve that are noisier?
2) The beginning of the curve is noisier than the end. I think this is could be because you have less data to use for actual testing toward the end, and therefore less variance between trials. If you have a lot of test data, you have a higher chance of having significant outliers.


3) At first I used 10, then 20, then 50, but only at 1000 trials was I satisfied that it was smooth enough. To see if I needed more trials, I just ran the program several times, checking for variance with the last time I ran the program. 


4) When C increases, the scale goes way up. So when C is 10, the scale of accuracy does down to 0.0 and 0.9. When C is lowered to 10^-20, it goes back to normal scale, but changes the curve! A very low C value, produces a minimal (less than 10%) accuracy for all percentages up to 70% of data used. On the graph, this makes a flat line, until the percentage used for training reaches 70, then it spikes to be about 30% accuracy. 

According to the documentation, higher values, of C give the model more freedom and lower values, make it more constrained. I think this means that it give more leeway for being close to accurate.
